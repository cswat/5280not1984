      <h2>Questions asked and answered</h2>
      <div class="FAQ d-flex flex-column">
        <details>
          <summary>What is facial recognition surveillance?</summary>
          <p class="m-1">Facial surveillance recognition is a technology that scans people in a video feed and uses an
          algorithm to compare still images to those in a reference database or on a watch list.
          The list of users includes the larger agencies like the FBI, NSA, and NYPD, but many local police
          forces are developing or integrating their own systems as well. It’s a wide-reaching network:
          In 2016, one in two American adults were in a law enforcement face recognition network. <br><br>
          In the ballot title, found <a
            href="files/Petition for initiated ordinance - facial recognition 2019.09.15.pdf">here</a>,
          it is simply defined as: <i>an automated or semi-automated process that assists in identifying or verifying an
            individual,
            based on the physical characteristics of an individual’s face.</i></p>

        </details>
        <details class="mt-1">
          <summary>Why ban facial recognition?</summary>
          <p class="m-1">In addition to the fundamental notion of government-ordained facial tracking being distasteful,
          the technology itself isn’t very effective. The facial surveillance recognition systems of today have a
          worryingly high rate of false positives, instances where a match is detected but turns out to be wrong.
          In London, the Metro Police have reported that <a
            href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/met-police-facial-recognition-success-south-wales-trial-home-office-false-positive-a8345036.html">
            98% of the matches in their trial software were inaccurate.</a> </br></br>
          Additionally, false positives are not evenly distributed among the population. MIT and Stanford researchers
          presented a
          paper last year stating that facial-analysis programs demonstrate both skin-type and gender biases.
          That’s because this technology relies on neural nets to analyze a library of faces and generate facial
          distinction points.
          The datasets most of these systems rely on overrepresent lighter-skinned men which means when a non-model
          individual is processed through
          the algorithm, they’re compared against fewer distinction points which leads to a higher rate of false positives
          and increases the
          risk of systemic abuse among these populations.</p>

        </details>
        <details class="mt-1">
          <summary>Do the police need facial recognition to do their jobs?</summary>
          <p class="m-1">It is not the intent of this ordinance to disrespect law enforcement agents. The job they do is often difficult
          and thankless
          and making their jobs easier should be a priority. Facial surveillance recognition does not make the lives of
          police easier. It’s an expensive system to integrate, it’s vulnerable, it’s open to abuse, but most of all
          it’s largely ineffective at its stated purpose. That may not be the case in 10 years, but it is the case now.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="mt-1">
          <summary>What are the negative effects of such a ban?</summary>
          <p class="m-1">It is the intent of this initiative to prevent the Denver municipal government from utilizing facial recognition
          software or
          information gathered from facial recognition software from any source. This would mean that city officials at
          Denver International Airport ("DIA"),
          which is operated by the city's Department of Aviation, would be prohibited from legally using information
          obtained from federal partners, like
          the Transportation Security Administration ("TSA"), Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI"), and Customs and
          Border Protection ("CBP"). <br><br>
          Additionally, this would prevent the use of such technologies in civillian agencies, like Denver's Motor Vehicle
          Division, which might utilize
          such a system in their driver's license database.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="mt-1">
          <summary>Has a ban like this been effected anywhere else?</summary>
          <p class="m-1">Yes, San Francisco, Oakland, and Somerville in Massachusetts have already passed local
          ordinances banning facial recognition. Denver would be the fourth city nationwide to implement such a
          prohibition.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="mt-1">
          <summary>Would private entities be affected by this ordinance?</summary>
          <p class="m-1">It is not the intent of this ordinance to interfere with a private entity’s development or usage of this
          technology.
          However, under the proposed ordinance, the Department of Aviation, and any other municipal agent in the City and
          County of Denver,
          would be prohibited from utilizing information obtained from a system if it qualifies as facial recognition
          surveillance.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="mt-1">
          <summary>Are there any exemptions?</summary>
          <p class="m-1">The only exemption listed in the ordinance text is the use of such a system for the purpose of redacting a
          recording
          for release or disclosure to protect the privacy of a subject depicted in the recording.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="mt-1">
          <summary>How would this be enforced?</summary>
          <p class="m-1">Any violation of this Ordinance constitutes an injury and any person may institute proceedings for injunctive
          relief,
          declaratory relief, or writ of mandate in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce this Ordinance.
          An action instituted under this paragraph shall be brought against Denver and, if necessary to effectuate
          compliance with this Ordinance,
          any other governmental agency with possession, custody, or control of data subject to this Ordinance.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="mt-1">
          <summary>A ban is very absolute; why not impose regulations around facial recognition?</summary>
          <p class="m-1">A wider ban allows any infringement upon the ban, for good or otherwise, to be accessible to the public. If
          Denver's city council elects
          to repeal all or part of the ban, the general population would be able to react in an appropriate and timely
          manner. Lighter regulations
          do not provide such a signalling mechanism and could even be used to expand a facial recognition dragnet.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="mt-1">
          <summary>Is the ordinance's definition of facial recognition too broad?</summary>
          <p class="m-1">The definition of “facial recognition surveillance” is any automated or semi-automated process that
          assists in identifying or verifying an individual, based on the physical characteristics of an individual’s
          face.
          There is no reason to believe that any reasonable body or person would, based on that definition, interpret more
          mundane video surveillance systems, like CCTV, as a form of facial recognition surveillance.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="mt-1">
          <summary>Would Denver be able to partner with other groups that use facial recognition?</summary>
          <p class="m-1">The intent of the proposed ordinance is not to limit Denver’s ability to share legally-obtained evidence or
          identifying
          information with other law enforcement bodies. However, if that evidence comes from a source classified as a
          facial recognition surveillance system
          then it would not be exempt from the ordinance's prohibition. </p>
        </details>
        <details class="mt-1">
          <summary>Does this ordinance prohibit police search warrants utilizing facial data from social media?</summary>
          <p class="m-1">Yes. Obtaining social media facial data as part of a search warrant would not be restricted but using it towards
          securing an arrest or charging an
          individual with crimes would be prohibited.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="mt-1">
          <summary>If this passes, could I still use a Ring or other video security system?</summary>
          <p class="m-1">Personal home security devices would not be subject to this ordinance. However, municipal law enforcement
          agencies would only be able to utilize
          such data if it did not meet the definition of a facial recognition surveillance system.</p>
